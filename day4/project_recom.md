# Video Streaming Platform Architecture Options

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 1: Cloud-Native, Fully Managed  
**Focus:** Time-to-Market + Scalability

### 1. Architecture Highlights
- **Ingestion:** Users upload videos ‚Üí Stored in Cloud Storage (GCS/S3/Azure Blob).  
- **Transcoding/Processing:** Use managed service (AWS Elastic Transcoder / GCP Transcoder API / Azure Media Services).  
- **Storage:** Transcoded files stored in CDN-backed storage bucket.  
- **Delivery:** Cloud CDN (CloudFront/Akamai/Azure CDN) for global low-latency streaming.  
- **Metadata & Users:** Cloud SQL / Firestore / DynamoDB for metadata (video title, user info).  
- **Search & Recommendations:** Managed AI/ML service (Vertex AI / SageMaker / Azure Cognitive Services).  
- **Authentication:** Cloud-native IAM + OAuth for users.

### 2. Trade-offs
- ‚úÖ Fast delivery ‚Üí minimal engineering overhead.  
- ‚úÖ Global scale with CDN.  
- ‚úÖ Low Ops cost ‚Üí managed services.  
- ‚ùå Higher $ cost (pay-per-use).  
- ‚ùå Vendor lock-in.

### 3. TPM Narrative
- **To Engineers:** "We‚Äôll use managed services to reduce complexity; dev team focuses on frontend + user experience."  
- **To Architects:** "Trade-off: higher cost but avoids custom transcoding infra."  
- **To Leadership:** "Faster go-to-market, predictable scaling; higher OPEX but less hiring needed."

## ‚úÖ Solution 2: Semi-Managed, Cost-Optimized  
**Focus:** Control + Maintainability

### 1. Architecture Highlights
- **Ingestion:** Videos uploaded into object storage.  
- **Transcoding:** Use Kubernetes/ECS running FFmpeg (open-source). Autoscale with GPUs.  
- **Storage:** Optimized into tiers:  
  - Hot storage (popular videos) ‚Üí SSD-backed.  
  - Cold storage (archived) ‚Üí cheaper blob/Glacier-tier.  
- **Delivery:** CDN + regional edge caches.  
- **Metadata:** PostgreSQL/MySQL with caching layer (Redis).  
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus/Grafana/Cloud-native monitoring.

### 2. Trade-offs
- ‚úÖ Lower cost (especially at scale).  
- ‚úÖ More control over video formats, codecs.  
- ‚úÖ Avoids vendor lock-in.  
- ‚ùå More DevOps work.  
- ‚ùå Slower time-to-market vs managed.

### 3. TPM Narrative
- **To Engineers:** "We‚Äôll leverage open-source FFmpeg, giving flexibility to optimize formats."  
- **To Architects:** "Trade-off: more complexity in ops, but better long-term cost efficiency."  
- **To Leadership:** "CapEx investment in infra + DevOps, but long-term cost advantage and portability."

## üéØ TPM Takeaway (for your learners)

- **Solution 1:** If the company is start-up mode: focus on fast launch, managed services.  
- **Solution 2:** If the company is scale mode: focus on cost optimization + control.  
- TPM must justify choice based on audience (engineer, architect, leadership).
